## System and software requirements
The project was created and executed on the NYU High Performance Computing (HPC) cluster [Greene](https://sites.google.com/a/nyu.edu/nyu-hpc/systems/greene-cluster). The code in this repo can run on any commercial laptop with Python 3 installed.

Python libraries:
- pandas 1.2.0
- numpy 1.19.2
- scipy 1.7.4
- matplotlib 3.3.2
- scikit-learn 0.24.2
- pycountry 20.7.3
- fuzzywuzzy 0.18.0
- beautifulsoup4 4.9.3
- Unidecode 1.3.1

Each Jupyter Notebook is self-contained and can be executed using a [Notebook Server](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/running.html). The expected outputs are in the Jupyter Notebooks themselves, as well as contained in the `figures/` directory.
